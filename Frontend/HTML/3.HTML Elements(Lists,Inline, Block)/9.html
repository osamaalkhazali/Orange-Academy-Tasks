        <h4>What is healthy diet?</h4>
        <p>
          Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
          unrealistically thin. or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
          Rather, it's about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
          health, and boosting your mood.

        While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise. we all need a balance of
        protein. fat. carbohydrates. fiber. vitamins. and minerals in our diets
        to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to eliminate certain
        categories of food from your diet. but rather select the healthiest
        options from each category.
