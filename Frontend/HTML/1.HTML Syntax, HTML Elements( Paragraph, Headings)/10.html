  <h2><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
  <p>Mathematics is the <mark> science and study of quality. stmcture. space. and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns. formulate new conjectures. and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>
  <p>There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations.
    The mathematician <strong> Benjamin Peirce </strong>called mathematics <q><u>the science that draws necessary conclusions</u></q>
    <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that  <q><u> As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</u></q> </p>
  
  <p>
    <u>Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields</u>, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes 
    leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in <strong>pure mathematics</strong>, or mathematics
    for its own sake. Without having any <strong>application</strong> in mind, practical applications for what is mathematics
    are often discovered later.

    <h2><u>Introduction to Chemistry.</u></h2>
    <p>
      <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. 
      <u>You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you.</u> Everything you touch or taste or smell is a 
      <strong>chemical</strong>, and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. 
      <mark><u>Chemistry forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.</u></mark> From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, 
      to the design, synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you...

      <del>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.</del> 
      <u>Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines</u>, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves. 
      <mark>Classical physics</mark> includes the study of mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics, while modern physics encompasses quantum mechanics and relativity.
